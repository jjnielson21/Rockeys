    About
    Slogan: Best Quality Burgers in town. Off the charts.
    Step into any ROCKEY BURGERS, and you’ll notice we’re different.
    From our famous (free) house-made pickles, to the hand-painted
    signage, to our cheerful staff, we build our restaurants like we build
    our burgers–sustainably, locally, and with an unwavering commitment
    to quality.
    Fresh, quality produce, meat, dairy and buns, sourced from partners
    located just miles from our restaurants, are the ingredients to making
    the perfect burger. This commitment to creating the best possible food
    for our guests is a direct reflection of our promise of creating fast food
    burgers using slow food values.
    Bite into any Super burger, and taste the difference.
    Our burgers, fries, and shakes are made with the finest,
    
    freshest ingredients available.
    
    All our beef is Rockey Farms, humanely-raised, vegetarian-fed,
    ground fresh daily, and sourced from a family-owned ranch.
    All of our shakes and cones are made with organic cream from
    Rockey Creamery, a small, family-owned, organic farm located South
    of Nephi, Utah.
    Our buns are baked to our specification by an artisan baker in Nephi,
    UT
    The potatoes we use to make our French fries are made from
    potatoes grown in North America by growers who are required to
    identify the genetic source of their seed potatoes. We do not work with
    genetically modified potato varieties. Our potatoes are processed
    fresh off the field and delivered to us without any modifications. We
    proudly serve Sir Kensington ketchup.
